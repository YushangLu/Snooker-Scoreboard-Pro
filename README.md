## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/snooker-scoreboard-pro.git
    cd snooker-scoreboard-pro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

This command starts the Vite development server for the React app.

```sh
npm run dev
```

---

## üì¶ Packaging for Production

To package the application for your local machine, run:

```sh
npm run electron:build
```

This will create a distributable file (`.exe`, `.dmg`, or `.AppImage`) inside the `release/` directory.

## ü§ñ Continuous Integration & Release Automation

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically build and release the application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### How It Works

1.  The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
2.  When a new version tag (e.g., `v2.1.0`) is pushed to the repository, the workflow is triggered.
3.  A `build` job runs in parallel on Windows, macOS, and Linux runners. Each runner builds its platform-specific version of the app.
4.  If all builds are successful, a `release` job starts.
5.  This job creates a new **Draft Release** on the GitHub "Releases" page.
6.  It then uploads all the built application packages (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`) to this draft release.
7.  You can then review the release and manually publish it.

### How to Trigger a New Release

1.  **Commit Your Changes**: Make sure all your latest code is committed to your main branch.

2.  **Set Up Code Signing (One-Time Setup)**: For users to trust your application, it must be code-signed. Go to your GitHub repository's `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and add the following secrets. This is crucial for macOS and Windows.

    -   `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple Developer email address.
    -   `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: An [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397) for your Apple ID.
    -   `CSC_LINK`: A base64 encoded version of your signing certificate.
        -   For macOS, this is your `.p12` file.
        -   For Windows, this is your `.pfx` file.
        -   **To create the secret**: Run the following command in your terminal and copy the output:
            ```sh
            # For macOS/Linux
            base64 -i your_certificate.p12 -o - | pbcopy 
            # For Windows (using PowerShell)
            [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("your_certificate.pfx")) | Set-Clipboard
            ```
    -   `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`: The password for your signing certificate.

3.  **Tag the Version**: Create a new Git tag locally. The version should match the one in `package.json`.
    ```sh
    # Example for version 2.1.0
    git tag v2.1.0
    ```

4.  **Push the Tag**: Push the tag to your GitHub repository. This is the action that triggers the release workflow.
    ```sh
    git push origin v2.1.0
    ```

5.  **Monitor and Publish**: Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to watch the progress. Once it completes, go to the "Releases" page, find your new draft, review it, and click "Publish release".
